#  zscale

potential enstrophy scaling (numeric value)


---

## Discussion
This is a depth-integrated area-averaged potential enstrophy.
 
  The default units are $m f^2$, where f gets set upon
  initialization of the WaveVortexModel.
 
  Set both zscale and zscale_units simultaneously to change the
  axis in the figures.
