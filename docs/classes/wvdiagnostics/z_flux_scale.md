#  z_flux_scale

potential enstrophy flux scaling (numeric value)


---

## Discussion
This is a depth-integrated area-averaged potential enstrophy per unit time..
 
  The default units are $m f^2/yr$, where f gets set upon
  initialization of the WaveVortexModel.
 
  Set both z_flux_scale and z_flux_scale_units simultaneously to change the
  axis in the figures.
