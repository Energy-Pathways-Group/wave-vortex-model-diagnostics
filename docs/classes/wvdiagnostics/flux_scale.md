#  flux_scale

energy flux scaling (numeric value)


---

## Discussion
This is a depth-integrated area-averaged energy per unit time.
 
  The default is 3.74/(86400*365), which corresponds to 1 GM per
  year.
 
  Set both flux_scale and flux_scale_units simultaneously to change the
  axis in the figures.
